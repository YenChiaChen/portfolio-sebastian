            “Antifragility helps build a systematic guide in any situation in
            which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete

            I believe speculative design can make designers and stakeholders
            "anti-fragile." It involves exploring the potential future
            trajectories of societies and organizations, allowing us{" "}

              to identify vulnerabilities and risks within services, and foster

              examination and refinement

            . Just as GDS and DEFRA found inspiration in this project,
            recognizing deficiencies in current government policy communication
            and initiating plans for innovative approaches to engage with the
            public, they can also utilize these future scenarios to proactively
            devise strategies - establishing systems to address potential
            challenges before they arise. This adaptability helps mitigate the
            scale of impacts and may lead to unexpected advantages.s

            Collaborating with scientists will make the project more powerful.

            In terms of the project limitations, I believe that collaboration
            with biologists and scientists can enrich policy design by
            incorporating realistic details. This includes considerations of
            ecological conditions and endangered species, ensuring that policies
            are both imaginative and grounded in reality. Such a collaborative
            approach will make the pilot policy more practical and vivid,
            fostering more powerful impact. <br />

            Thanks to the GDS team and my teammates for their invaluable
            contributions. This enriching experience in policy design and
            communication has been a tremendous learning opportunity for me.
