          I prioritize designing "with" people with ADHD rather than designing
          "for" them. I recognized these individuals as integral partners in the
          development of services and avoiding making decisions on their behalf.
          With this inclusive mindset, I can ensure that the designed services
          are refined and aligned with the lifestyles and habits of young adults
          with ADHD.

          When conducting workshops, I wanted to ensure that both individuals

          the role of a visual facilitator, helping participants express their
          concepts visually, even if they lack confidence in drawing.</span> By
          sketching out their ideas on the spot, I facilitate deeper
          conversation and ensure that every concept is thoroughly explored and
          discussed.
