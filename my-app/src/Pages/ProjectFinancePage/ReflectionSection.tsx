          Throughout the project, I noted a potential drawback of the Design
          Thinking framework: the risk of inadvertently viewing "individuals" as
          "problems to be solved," leading to stigma. To address this, I
          abandoned "deliberate empathy". I approached stakeholders with the
          mindset of "letâ€™s have a friendly chat" rather than "I'm here to help
          you and understand your situation," treating stakeholders as equals.
          In this way, they are more likely to open up, provide input on
          prototypes, and even offer new ideas. I believe that significant
          design breakthroughs occur in such inclusive environments.

          Overall, is inclusive design inclusive?
        </p>
        <p className="text-[18px] font-light mt-4">
          Despite immersing myself in various inclusive design mindsets and
          tools during the project, I pondered whether the term "inclusive
          design" genuinely indicates inclusivity if designers must rely on it
          to maintain inclusive attitudes. I often question whether I am
          genuinely inclusive or if I still harbor a privileged perspective that
          centers on designers. My aspiration is to authentically regard each
          user as equal and unique, without needing to label it as inclusive
          design. I see this as a continuous journey, and while I've made
          significant strides in embracing and implementing inclusive design
          principles, there's always room for growth. Moving forward, I am
          committed to carrying this spirit into future design endeavors.
