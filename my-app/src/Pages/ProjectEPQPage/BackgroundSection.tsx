          The Challenge of Career Development and Lack of Confidence in Learning

        <p className="text-[18px] font-light mt-1">
          People with non-traditional learning backgrounds, including those who
          have battled addiction, mental issues, and ex-offenders, often
          encounter a familiar obstacle: the necessity for A-level
          qualifications in the job market.
          <span className="font-bold">
            This requirement creates a hurdle to stable employment and career
            advancement and undermines their confidence in re-entering the
            education system.{" "}
          </span>
          To support individuals from non-traditional educational backgrounds in
          obtaining these qualifications, Open Book at Goldsmiths University
          provides Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) courses. These
          initiatives aim to dismantle the barriers that discourage people from
          pursuing higher education, helping them regain confidence and
          enthusiasm for learning.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[24px] font-bold mt-8">
          However, the current EPQ teaching structure still leans towards
          traditional academia.

        <p className="text-[18px] font-light mt-1 mb-8">
          While Open Book's EPQ course caters to individuals from
          non-traditional backgrounds, its current structure leans towards
          traditional teaching methods. Learners are required to navigate
          various research methodologies and complete literature reviewing
          forms. This approach might be perceived as tedious for non-traditional
          learners, resulting in a{" "}

          As service designers, can we reimagine the course to be more engaging?

            How might we infuse the spirit of design thinking to foster a more
            motivating and enjoyable learning journey for these non-traditional
            learners?
