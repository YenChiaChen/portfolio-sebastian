          In this project, my team and I addressed a common educational issue:
          the tendency towards standardised learning. Through design, we
          injected diversity into the unified service system, valuing the
          potential of individuals and creating a motivating learning
          environment. Witnessing non-traditional learners express passion for
          subjects like anthropology and filmmaking was inspiring, as it led to
          profound self-discovery. This experience highlighted the{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            {" "}
            importance of designers advocating for inclusion and accessibility,
          </span>{" "}
          demonstrating the power of service design to unlock endless
          possibilities for individuals.
