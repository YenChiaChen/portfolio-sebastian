          In the rapidly evolving services of Web3 and NFTs, there remain
          abundant opportunities for exploration and optimization. While the NFT
          market is undeniably competitive, I believe sustained success hinges
          not on leveraging celebrity endorsements or artist collaborations.
          Instead, a robust NFT project service is essential for fostering
          enduring relationships with followers and maximizing the benefits of
          NFT ownership.{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            {" "}
            Through systematic analysis and design, the NFT owner experience
            should evoke feelings of pleasure and achievement, driving
            meaningful engagement.
          </span>{" "}
          As a strategy and service designer, this is the goal which I am
          committed to.
