          The burgeoning NFT art market has garnered significant attention
          amidst the ascent of blockchain technology. In 2021, NFT transactions
          soared to an impressive Â£19.2 billion in trading volume, drawing
          participation from approximately 28.6 million active accounts.

              Navigating the current NFT trading journey proves arduous for
              many. Traders must scour multiple websites to gather essential
              information such as project roadmaps, historical prices, minting
              volume, and popularity before making a purchase. Additionally,
              staying abreast of the latest project developments often
              necessitates prolonged engagement in Discord groups associated
              with NFT projects.
